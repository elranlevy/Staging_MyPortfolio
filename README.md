  ### Push without typing credentials (one-time SSH setup)

  Run once: `./scripts/setup-github-ssh.sh`  
  It creates an SSH key and switches the repo to SSH. Add the printed key at [GitHub SSH keys](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new). After that, `git push` and `git pull` work without asking for credentials.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
